make an archive page
-every time files are uploaded
-they are tagged with the access code
- and added to the archive page
- and are downloadable.
- that way you can always go back to
- the original configuration 
- and you know where it came from. 


use a list of ip addresses
to figure out what should be
in the config files. 
add a field to the import page
this should allow to auto select
what check boxes should be selected.
